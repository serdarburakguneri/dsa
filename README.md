# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to a variety of data structures problems.

## Tech/Framework Used

* Java 17,
* JUnit 5,
* Maven

## Usage Instructions

To run the tests, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Or, you can run the tests individually using your favorite IDE.

## Problems and Solutions

PS: You may see code duplication in some of the solutions. This is intentional to keep the solutions isolated from each
other.

I am having this repository as a reference for myself and others to learn and understand or remember the problems.
So please think of this as a learning resource rather than a production-ready codebase.
